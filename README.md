# Signal Generator Web App
This web app is to represent how you can use streamlit to interactively generate signals using Numpy and Scipy packages. Also, you can download the generated signal as a csv file.

There are 6 python files in this repository:
- **app.py**: the main file of the web app.
- **Signal.py**: the class to generate the a specific type of signal at a specific sampling rate, frequency, duration, and amplitude.
- **documentation.py**: the documentation that appears in the web app to explain the aim of this application.
- **download_signal.py**: to specify the way you want to download the generated signals.
- **select_signal.py**: to interactively select the signal you want to generate using the predefined parameters by Signal class.
- **viz_signal.py**: plot the signal using plotly line plot.

### Note:
You can combine the whole python files in one, but it'll be too bulky. This way, it's better for re-editing the code blocks and better for understanding the code.
